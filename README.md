# Zillow-clone

This is a zillow-clone challenge i decided to take on. To be honest, I looked at Zillow's page and thought it might be a bit difficult but I knew I had to try and practice my HTML and CSS. I felt pretty comfortable especially practicing more with flexbox and using it to layout content.

Unfortunately, this clone is not responsive. I am not feeling comfortable with making things responsive but I know i can get it done. 

Hopefully everyone enjoys this clone website!
